💫 Hello! I'm VICAREON. That's an anagram for Veronica, but you can also call me Vee. 

💡 I'm a programmer who wants to help people and shape the future through my code.

🛠️ I enjoy working with Java (and Groovy!), JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML and CSS. Currently I'm expanding my knowledge on frameworks with Spring and Angular. My IDE of choice is Intellij IDEA and I love using Git Kraken. 

🌼 Thank you for stopping by!
